Method1:
Uses Approximation of the line between circles

Method2:
Color the line found out by Hough tranform and Find the max and 
min point as end of the line segment
COlor only if there exists a white pixel beneath the line

Use flood fill to

Method3:
Apply HOugh transform between Circles

Method4:
